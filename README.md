**Project Title:** InstaBot

**Project Description:**

This project creates an Instagram bot that can be used to automate various tasks on Instagram, such as:

* Login to an Instagram account
* Search for Instagram handles
* Open an Instagram profile
* Follow or unfollow an Instagram handle
* Like or unlike an Instagram post
* Extract a list of followers of an Instagram handle
* Check the story of an Instagram handle

The project also analyzes the habits of food bloggers on Instagram by:

* Finding the top 5 Instagram handles with the highest number of followers
* Finding the number of posts that these handles have done in the previous 3 days
* Plotting a graph of this information
* Scraping the content of the first 10 posts of the top 5 Instagram handles
* Preparing a list of all words used in all the scraped posts and calculating the frequency of each word
* Creating a CSV file with two columns: the word and its frequency
* Finding the hashtags that were most popular among these bloggers
* Plotting a pie chart of the top 5 hashtags obtained and the number of times they were used by these bloggers in the scraped posts
* Calculating the average followers:likes ratio for the top 5 Instagram handles
* Finding out the likes of the top 10 posts of each handle
* Calculating the average likes for a handle
* Dividing the average likes obtained from the number of followers of the handle to get the average followers:like ratio of each handle
* Plotting a bar graph to depict the above obtained information

**Project Methodology:**

The project uses the Selenium library to automate tasks on Instagram. Selenium is a powerful tool that can be used to automate tasks on a variety of websites.

The project first imports the necessary libraries and then creates a Chrome driver. The Chrome driver is used to control the Chrome browser.

The project then defines a number of functions that can be used to automate tasks on Instagram. These functions are used to login to an Instagram account, search for Instagram handles, open an Instagram profile, follow or unfollow an Instagram handle, like or unlike an Instagram post, extract a list of followers of an Instagram handle, check the story of an Instagram handle, find the top 5 Instagram handles with the highest number of followers, find the number of posts that these handles have done in the previous 3 days, plot a graph of this information, scrape the content of the first 10 posts of the top 5 Instagram handles, prepare a list of all words used in all the scraped posts and calculate the frequency of each word, create a CSV file with two columns: the word and its frequency, find the hashtags that were most popular among these bloggers, plot a pie chart of the top 5 hashtags obtained and the number of times they were used by these bloggers in the scraped posts, calculate the average followers:likes ratio for the top 5 Instagram handles, find out the likes of the top 10 posts of each handle, calculate the average likes for a handle, and divide the average likes obtained from the number of followers of the handle to get the average followers:like ratio of each handle.

The project then calls these functions to automate the tasks on Instagram.
